A city of rich history and tradition
Dhaka's history is a story of changing fortunes, leaving behind a legacy of architectural wonders and diverse cultural influences.
Mughal era (17th–18th century): Dhaka rose to prominence as the capital of Bengal Subah under the Mughals and was known as Jahangirnagar. It became one of the most prosperous cities in the world and a global center for the muslin trade, attracting merchants from across Eurasia. Historic buildings like the incomplete Lalbagh Fort and the majestic Bara Katra caravan serai are from this period.
British period (18th–20th century): After coming under British control, Dhaka experienced a decline in prominence before a resurgence in the early 20th century, serving as the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The city saw the introduction of electricity, railways, and Western-style universities, earning the University of Dhaka the nickname "Oxford of the East".
Rise of independent Bangladesh (1947–1971): Following the Partition of India, Dhaka became the capital of East Pakistan. It was the epicenter of the Bengali nationalist movement, which culminated in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In that year, Dhaka emerged as the national capital of newly independent Bangladesh.
A megacity of extraordinary growth
In the decades since independence, Dhaka has undergone a population boom, driven largely by rapid urbanization and internal migration. The urban core is one of the most densely populated in the world, and the larger metropolitan area is one of the fastest-growing mega-cities globally. This growth, however, has also created immense pressure on the city's infrastructure and services.
Economic powerhouse
Dhaka is the economic heart of Bangladesh, accounting for a significant portion of the country's GDP. Key economic drivers include:
Garment industry: Dhaka is a major center for Bangladesh's ready-made garment industry, a primary source of foreign exchange.
Financial center: The city is home to the Bangladesh Bank, the national central bank, as well as the Dhaka Stock Exchange and many multinational companies.
A vibrant and chaotic culture
Dhaka's culture is a blend of its storied past and its dynamic present, characterized by a bustling street life and a rich culinary heritage.
Culinary fame: The city is renowned for its traditional Mughal cuisine, including flavorful biryani and bakarkhani.
UNESCO-recognized heritage: The city's colorful rickshaw art and the traditional Jamdani sari have been recognized by UNESCO as part of humanity's intangible cultural heritage.
Festivals: A calendar of vibrant festivals animates the city, including the Bengali New Year parade, known as Pohela Boishakh.
Challenges and the path forward
As one of the world's most densely populated cities, Dhaka faces significant urban challenges, including:
Traffic congestion: The city's chaotic and congested traffic is a well-known feature, with residents spending hours commuting and suffering from high levels of air and noise pollution.
Environmental issues: Dhaka's waterways, like the Buriganga River, have become heavily polluted by industrial waste, and the city faces flooding risks during the monsoon season.
Urban inequality: The wealth gap is stark, with modern, affluent neighborhoods existing alongside vast, crowded slums, where nearly a third of the population lives.
In response, Dhaka is pursuing ambitious projects, including the construction of the Metro Rail, to modernize infrastructure and improve the quality of life for its residents. These initiatives represent the city's ongoing effort to build a more sustainable and resilient future.
